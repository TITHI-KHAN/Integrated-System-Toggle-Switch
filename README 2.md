# Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) Prototype

This Chrome extension was used in the paper "Design and Evaluation of an Automatic Text Simplification Prototype with Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Readers" presented at the ASSETS 2024 Conference. It provides a customizable interface for ATS systems.

## Installing The Extension
- Open Chrome Extension Settings (chrome://extensions), turn on developer mode, select "Load Unpacked", and select the project directory named *app*.

## Running the API
- Make sure the virtualenv is active (if it isn't, run 'source thanos/bin/activate' assuming your virtual env is named thanos)
  - If you don't have a virtualenv set up yet, see "API Set-up for First Time Use" below.
- From the main directory, run 'python api/manage.py runserver.' A message saying "Starting development server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`" should display.


## API Set-up for First Time Use
- Set up a virtual env
  - To create one, follow these steps:
    - Install the [virtualenv Python package](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) using pip (i.e. 'pip install virtualenv')
	- Then, from the main directory, run 'python -m virtualenv thanos'
  - Activate the virtual env (i.e. run 'source thanos/bin/activate' assuming your virtual env is named thanos)
  - Then, install the required packages by running 'pip install -r api/requirements'

\* *Depending on your setup, you might need to type 'python3' instead of 'python' when typing the commands above, and 'pip3' instead of 'pip'*

# Example

**Once the extension is installed and the API is running, it should work with this paragraph:**

This paragraph, meticulously composed with a deliberate complexity, stands as a quintessential example of intricate writing, aimed at illustrating the sophisticated interplay of syntax, diction, and thematic depth that can be achieved through careful linguistic craftsmanship. Conceived and articulated by me, it exemplifies how a writer can deftly employ an array of advanced vocabulary, multifaceted sentence structures, and layered meanings to construct a narrative that not only challenges the reader's cognitive engagement but also enriches their interpretive experience. 

By weaving together a rich tapestry of descriptive language, nuanced insights, and seamless transitions, the paragraph aspires to transcend mere textual communication, embodying instead a form of intellectual artistry. In doing so, it serves a dual purpose: to provide a concrete demonstration of the potential for complexity in writing to enhance both the aesthetic and analytical dimensions of a text, and to underscore my own proficiency in the art of crafting elaborate and thought-provoking prose.
As twilight descended over the sprawling metropolis, the cityscape transformed into a glittering mosaic of neon lights and shadowy silhouettes, while the hum of activity below created a symphony of urban life, punctuated by the occasional distant wail of sirens. Amidst the cacophony of the bustling city, where the relentless clatter of footsteps and the distant hum of traffic intertwined like a chaotic symphony, she found solace in the small, hidden garden nestled between towering skyscrapers, where the delicate fragrance of jasmine and the soft rustling of leaves offered a fleeting escape from the frenetic pace of urban life.

In the shadowy recesses of the ancient library, where time seemed to stand still amidst the towering shelves laden with dusty tomes and forgotten manuscripts, a faint whisper of parchment rustled as if sharing secrets with the dimly lit, flickering candles that cast an ethereal glow over the labyrinthine aisles. The air, heavy with the musty scent of aged paper and the faint tang of ink, was punctuated only by the occasional creak of the wooden floorboards beneath the weight of countless years of accumulated knowledge. As she wandered through the labyrinth of literature, each step echoed with the silent reverence of centuries past, and the intricate patterns of the ornate ceiling seemed to come alive, reflecting the kaleidoscope of her thoughts that danced between the realms of history and imagination. The contrast between the stillness of the room and the vibrant life within the pages created an almost tangible tension, as if the very essence of wisdom and wonder were whispering just out of reach, inviting her to delve deeper into the mysteries hidden within those hallowed walls.

Bathed in the golden hues of the setting sun, the sprawling vineyard stretched out like a mosaic of emerald and sapphire, its orderly rows of grapevines weaving a tapestry of shadows and light that danced across the undulating hills, while the distant chirping of crickets and the soft murmur of a gently flowing stream created a serene symphony that seemed to echo the timeless rhythm of nature's own heartbeat.

In the heart of the enigmatic forest, where the ancient trees formed a cathedral of intertwining branches and the soft, dappled sunlight filtered through the verdant canopy in a mosaic of fleeting golden beams, a hidden clearing emerged like a secret sanctuary, where the air was thick with the intoxicating aroma of wildflowers and the gentle hum of bees, creating an ephemeral haven that seemed untouched by the relentless march of time.

Enveloped by the twilight's gentle embrace, the once vibrant carnival now lay abandoned, its faded tents and rusting rides casting long, mournful shadows across the cracked pavement, while the distant echo of an old, forgotten carousel melody mingled with the soft rustling of autumn leaves, creating a poignant tapestry of nostalgia and melancholy that lingered in the cool, evening air. High above the sprawling metropolis, where the labyrinth of city lights flickered like a constellation of artificial stars against the backdrop of the velvet night sky, the solitary figure perched on the rooftop surveyed the endless sea of concrete and steel below, their mind drifting through the tangled web of dreams and ambitions that mirrored the intricate patterns of the illuminated streets, as the cool breeze carried whispers of forgotten stories and distant promises.

Nestled within the mist-covered mountains, where the ancient pine trees stood like silent sentinels guarding the secrets of the earth, the secluded monastery clung to the rugged cliffs, its weathered stone walls etched with the passage of centuries, while the faint tolling of a distant bell reverberated through the crisp morning air, echoing the monks' unbroken rhythm of prayer and meditation, as if time itself bowed in reverence to the sacred tranquility of the place.

As the first rays of dawn pierced the horizon, painting the sky in hues of amber and rose, the vast desert landscape slowly awakened, its rolling dunes casting elongated shadows that danced with the shifting sands, while the solitary figure trudging across the endless expanse felt both the weight of isolation and the profound silence that stretched infinitely in every direction, as if the very essence of time was suspended in the breathless stillness of the morning.

Beneath the vast expanse of the star-studded night, where the cosmos unfolded in a dazzling display of celestial wonder, the lone astronomer stood atop the windswept plateau, his gaze fixed on the distant galaxies swirling in the inky depths of space, while the quiet hum of the universe filled the air with a profound sense of awe, as if the very fabric of reality was whispering secrets of existence that transcended the limits of human understanding.

Under the weight of the storm-laden sky, where dark clouds churned like a tempestuous sea and flashes of lightning illuminated the jagged peaks of the distant mountains, the small village huddled in the valley below seemed almost fragile, its flickering lanterns struggling against the encroaching darkness, while the wind howled through the narrow streets, carrying with it the ominous scent of rain and the foreboding promise of nature's untamed fury.

Amid the ancient ruins, where weathered stones bore silent witness to the rise and fall of forgotten empires, a soft breeze stirred the overgrown vines that clung to the crumbling walls, carrying with it the faint scent of jasmine and the distant murmur of a hidden stream, as the lone traveler, standing at the edge of history, felt the weight of centuries pressing down, intertwining the echoes of the past with the fleeting moments of the present.

In the heart of the ancient cathedral, where the towering stained glass windows cast a kaleidoscope of colors onto the cold stone floor, the solemn silence was punctuated only by the distant echo of footsteps and the soft murmur of a lone chant, as the ethereal light bathed the worn pews and the intricately carved altars in a reverent glow, creating an atmosphere where time seemed to dissolve into the sacred stillness of the moment.

A gentle breeze carried the scent of blooming jasmine through the quiet, moonlit garden.

# Usage

The extension sends all sentences to the API and expects a JSON object in return. The API is currently using a file called sample.json which demonstrates the format that the extension expects to receive from the API. 

To use your own system, you can start by modifying the models.py file under /api to use a live model instead of pulling from the sample file. Alternatively, you or your model can create a JSON file following the sample format and the existing code should continue to work.

# Known Issues

- When using temporary in-place replacements, if the replacement text is shorter than the original, that may cause it toggle really quickly and sometimes get stuck.
- Lexical simplification only works with individual words. However, current simplifications models may also simplify phrases.
